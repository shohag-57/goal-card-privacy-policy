  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Deletion</h3>
    <p>If you uninstall the Goal Card App, all your data will be permanently deleted from your device. We have no way to recover this data as we do not store it on our servers.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
